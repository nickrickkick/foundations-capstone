showing off all that I have learned in the first 16 weeks

the client side will have all the front-end work with 4 html pages, 4 js pages, and 1 css page
they will mainly focus on giving info to the server 
the index.html page will focus on getting info from the server to show what is in the db.

the server folder will have 2 js files for doing the express and sql work.
i use express, and sequelize 
sequelize will mainly work with postgress sql with heroku
